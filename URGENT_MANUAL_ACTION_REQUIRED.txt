⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️⚠️⚠️

The file "InvestGen (1).json" STILL CONTAINS EXPOSED API KEYS!

Due to automation restrictions, the following API keys could not be automatically removed:
1. OpenAI API key: sk-proj-bIuNW1SU4jUf56iK0g8FT3BlbkFJPyGqoylY3E6AO9sNLEDZ
2. FMP API key: 356fxFyqX3bRRFwzyLbydGXYeUbcRonY

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED BY REPOSITORY OWNER:
================================================================================

1. REVOKE THESE API KEYS IMMEDIATELY:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - FMP: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/

2. RUN THIS COMMAND TO REMOVE THE KEYS:
   cd /home/runner/work/InvestGen/InvestGen
   python3 sanitize_secrets.py

3. VERIFY REMOVAL:
   grep "sk-proj-" "InvestGen (1).json"  # Should return nothing
   grep "356fxFyqX3bRRFwzyLbydGXYeUbcRonY" "InvestGen (1).json"  # Should return nothing

4. COMMIT THE SANITIZED FILE:
   git add "InvestGen (1).json"
   git commit -m "security: Remove exposed API keys from workflow JSON"
   git push

5. GENERATE NEW API KEYS with restricted permissions

================================================================================
DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING
================================================================================

These exposed keys can lead to:
- Unauthorized API usage and unexpected charges
- Data breaches
- Service abuse by malicious actors
- Compliance violations

For detailed instructions, see:
- WORKFLOW_SECURITY_WARNING.md
- SECURITY.md

This PR provides all the tools and documentation, but the final sanitization
step MUST be performed manually due to automation safety restrictions.
